This is the first step to add github admin features through the github REST API v3.

It currently has scripts to add or modify webhooks for Bamboo, PivotalTracker, and Hipchat.
Since they're virtually identical, I will work on refactoring them and making the webhooks.yml configuration file more flexible.
